## Turntable caster

I bought a pack of generic 12 fixed-position casters on Amazon. They worked just
fine. There's really nothing to optimize here.

## Speed Reducers

Make: Worldwide Electric
Model: CALM50-30/1-56C

Called 971-227-3381 Tyler from Worldwide Electric. Mount position will be M5 or
M6, both oil fill levels are the same. The unit ships filled with Mobil SHC632
oil. Little brass bolt is a pressure-release bolt, used in applications where
there is enough heat to build up a lot of pressure inside the gearbox.

These were really expensive, but they were way lighter than similar models from
other manufacturers and seem incredibly well built.

## Mechanical considerations

### v1: Wood push arms

Tried using wood arms with a hole drilled for the 5/8" threaded rod that I use
for the eccentric and the fixed arm. The holes were actually somewhat larger to
accommodate some bronze thrust bushings that I used to help reduce friction.
This turned out to be perfect on the tool side to fit the pipe and flange I used
as a ring tool.

Almost immediately it became clear that having a really tight fit for the moving
parts doesn't really work. Flex in the system, and particularly on the eccentric
drive rod, torques on the arms, which twists the tool and causes it to tip
dangerously.

Widening the holes on the arms only helped somewhat, and compromised the motion
of the tool by creating lots of slop in the whole mechanism.

### v2: Threaded rod arms

Realizing that this wasn't going to work unless I eliminated the torque from the
eccentric drive rod, I bought some heim joints and threaded rod to act as arms.
Initially I tried heim joints on both ends of the arms, but putting one on the
tool side doesn't work at all - it just makes the tool tip.
